NEOART 2.0
========
This is a modifaction of the original code 
https://github.com/Neoclassics/neoart
with very limited functionality.

It is only designed to calculate the current in the banana platea using additional source terms
connected with the turbulent velocity non-linearity:

Seiferling, F., Peeters, A. G., Buchholz, R., Grosshauser, S. R., Rath, F., & Weikl, A. (2018).
On turbulence driven stationary electric currents in a tokamak. Physics of Plasmas, 25(10), 102305.

NOTE: This code was only designed for personal use, i.e. there is little error catching and it is only usable
in a specific fashion which is not really documented. I recommend to use the original code and expand on that.
Absolutely no warranty for any results obtained.


NEOART
======

Neoart is a code that calculates the neoclassical transport coefficients for
toroidal geometry

NOTE: This is a work in progress.  At present only download the code if you
know what you are doing (and even then you may be disappointed)

Compilation
-----------

A simple

    make

should do to compile Neoart and the tests.

Building Neoart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make neoart


Building the Matlab interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make matlab

Run matlab and change into the matlab directory.  You should be able to run
neoart in matlab using the wrapper called by the command 'neoart'.  Type 'help
neoart' for more information.

You can test your mexfile compilation by running test1.m in matlab. The output
should be:

ans =

   3.7263e+07


coeff =

    1.1645


vpol =

   4.6578e+03


Compiling and running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tests are located in the tests directory.  To compile and run all tests:

    $ make tests


Building the Python interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to have numpy [1] and the Python development headers installed.

    make python
